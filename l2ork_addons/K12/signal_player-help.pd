#X text 17 9 DESCRIPTION This allows you to play WAV files at different
pitches and different directions;
#X text 16 42 INLET_0 Connect a number here to change the pitch of
the playback and immediately trigger the sound (60 = normal speed)
;
#X text 15 77 INLET_1 Send 1 to replay the sound at the last known
pitch. Send 0 to stop the playack.;
#X text 15 111 OUTLET_0 Output sound;
#X text 15 131 OUTLET_1 Outputs 1 when the playback is over.;

#X text 227 440 To Open a File: click on the yellow open button.;
#X text 227 345 To Playback: Send into left inlet the number of the
desired pitch. A pitch of 60 plays the original sound as it was recorded.
The Player will only playback the range you specify with the start
and end sliders with the leftmost side being the beginning of the sound
and the rightmost its end. Use the first preset to play the sound at
pitch 60;
#X text 227 162 The Player object allows you to play WAV soundfiles
at different speeds and in different directions. Please note that the
object supports WAV files ONLY. The left inlet sets the playback pitch
(default 60). 60 plays the original sound without any chance. Less
than 60 lowers the pitch and increases duration \, while numbers higher
than 60 result in higher pitch and shorter duration. The right inlet
allows you to play the same sound with same settings again by sending
it a 1 or stop the playing sound by sending it a 0 You can pick at
what point the sound starts and ends with the sliders. If you put the
start slider past the end slider \, then the sample will play backwards.
The left outlet outputs the sound \, while the right one outputs 1
when the sound playback is over. You can use the output from the right
outlet to loop the sound (see below).;
#X text 226 463 To preview the sound \, click on the green play button.
It will play the sound using the last requested pitch.;
#X text 227 508 Looping sound: As shown in this example \, we can loop
the sound by using the second outlet. Every time the sound stops \,
the second outlet will output a 1 If we use this to push the value
stored in the right number above the player \, as long as there is
a 1 inside it the sound will continue to loop. Once you change the
right number's value to 0 the Player will stop looping. Recall the
second preset to preview the loop mode.;
